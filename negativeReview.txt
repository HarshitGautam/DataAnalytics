This is absolutely the worst computer EVER! If you are ordering it because of the price - just keep saving your money and get something decent. The touchpad is so insanely sensitive that I frequently will not be touching anything, but just from my hand being NEAR IT, will send me to different screens, completely erase a full email I have just written, etc. Also, the battery life is a joke; you get maybe an hour off the charger before it completely dies. I bought this through a different company than Amazon.The scroll options don't do anything and occasionally the touchpad doesn't work at all. Definitely not what I intended to buy.What a waste of time and money. The screen's backlight wasn't working on my first power up......- Despite being packaged with Windows 10, this computer does not come with any Microsoft Office applications, and you must spend at least a further $70 for these additions, most of which are packaged into one-year plans that will ultimately cost you more than buying the lifelong package for $150. I believe this was automatically featured with computers that had prepackaged Windows 7 and 8, but I could be wrong about that, but it is certainly not the case for Windows 10. So, a "word" of advice: save up your money for the better deal and NEVER purchase a one-year package. SSD option is pretty small. The default system takes up 20GB alone.
- Comes with Dell, Intel, McAfee and Microsoft bloatware (which you can safely remove).
- Feels cheap (well it is). The construction doesn't feel solid. The keyboard and touchpad feel plasticky.
- Power connector is so thin, feels like it could break.the power adapter port inside the computer came loose and fell back into the computer casing. Dell said it is not a warranty issue. This unit was purchased 3 months ago. Poorly made laptop and a Dell is a poor company that doesn't support or stand behind it's product. Do not waste your time or money.I returned the first laptop (without any issues) as the light showing the hard drive was working or the power was on was not working and the startup script was not working correctly - it rebooted the machine but didn't continue running the setup. I received second computer quickly (two days, I’m a Prime Member) and the light worked and setup went smoothly. No issue on returning the first laptop.

New issue my husband let me know about yesterday. The speakers are fading in and out when playing any video. He said this was on all videos he has played (YouTube mostly) and has done this since we purchased the laptop. I have not done any troubleshooting yet, but will check the drivers and update this review if I find a resolution. I have not contacted the seller yet to report this issue but I will soon as I would like to have this resolved before the laptop is out of warranty.

This is NOT a touch screen computer and there is no DVD drive for playing or burning disks.I returned the computer because the mouse pad had a glitch (it would automatically open a page when passing over it). The celeron processor was much slower than a pentium processor. I was very happy with amazons return process.This machine is slow as molasses and it had pop-up after pop-up on the very first use. I hate the fact that there seems to be no onscreen on/off or rest button. If you haven't upgraded in a while you will find it confusing to navigate; so much is taken for granted as far as user knowledge.
I truly regret buying this computer.
And did I mention how unbelievably SLOW it is !
