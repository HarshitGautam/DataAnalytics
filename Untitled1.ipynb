      "If I could give this a 0 I would. �Worst dining experience ever. My dessert arrived before one of my friend's entrees had even gotten to the table. �We complained to manager who \"fixed\" it by dumping everything else we had ordered at our table all at once. My friend's steak was rare (she ordered it medium well) so she sent it back, and they just threw it back on the grill and charred it black on the outside. When she cut it open it was still bloody. �Food was cold and horrible. �Tiny portions, even for a tapas place (my soup spoon was the size of my niece's baby spoons - seriously). �The server told us they had lambrusco and then proceeded to bring us rose champagne - he was adamant it was lambrusco. �Friend asked for a biscuit on the side (from another menu item) and server said they couldn't do that. �Seriously? �We were happy to pay for it. �Server and manager both rude. �$300 dollars later and we were all starving and annoyed.

      "I've just hit the three month mark in my stint away from all those I love and care about in DC and it's made me a bit reflective of the great friends and great food that I miss. Despite having spent multiple days per week in Logan Circle for well over a year, Justin and I never made it to Cork together, generally opting for new restaurants or spending the evening cooking together instead. So when Carol, Jenn and I finally picked a date and time for a girls happy hour - a feat more difficult than it sounds - I finally had an excuse to visit Cork. We started by grabbing a glass at the bar where the bartender was informative and helpful, pouring samples before filling the glasses. All wines by the glass are within the $8-16 range with most being $10-13 and there is a decent sized selection of roses and whites in addition to the breadth of reds.We didn't have to wait long after making our selections before a table was ready and we ventured outside to sit on the patio. It helped that it was still early, before the main rush of dinner, but it was key to order a beverage at the bar since happy hour prices aren't available outside. Two small tables were pushed together for our party of three which allowed for ample room for the shared plates, though the tables were a bit wobbly. Jenn insisted we get the avocado toasts (avocado, pistachios, toasted pistachio oil and sea salt over thinly sliced grilled bread) as she'd had it before, and it did not disappoint. In fact, I loved it so much that I've replicated it at home for a quick and easy weekend breakfast. We also split the hangar steak (with roasted fingerlings, mustard greens, salsa verde), duck confit (with frisée salad, tilston point blue, pickled cherries) and a couple of other dishes. Our meal added up quickly and seemed a bit pricey, especially considering it was originally just happy hour snacks that ended up turning into a full meal, but the food and wine were good and the company was even better. It's evenings like this that you take a bit for granted until you're far away and realize that a splurge every now and again is more than worth it to have some much needed girl time. Of note, Cork does have a Sunday brunch from 11-3. Some of the menu items are the same as the dinner menu but they also have breakfasty items and some pastries that look really good. Or maybe bacon cheddar scones just sound absolutely amazing because I haven't had pork in three months.\n",

      "Budding oenophiles and veteran tasters rejoice! Cork serves up fulsome bites along with a varied wine selection.This inviting wine bar is well-lit and not overflowing with tables - those are chiefly for dinner. A rear dining room has more seating, though the room itself is not obvious upon first inspection.We were irked by a not-exactly-inviting hostess, but the bartender (forgot his name!) was cheery, getting us what we needed.The kitchen turns out surprisingly good fare. We shared calamari, a delightful avacado on toast, and charcuterie: the San Daniele prosciutto, Hudson Valley duck salami, and Palacios chorizo (the trio was $15, a good deal). The duck salami was satisfying to render, the chorizo a must-try, and the chorizo's pronounced, smoky flavor made me curse in wonder. For drinks, a friend and I both sipped Prosecco wine flights - creative, fun, smooth - netting us three glasses each.Flavors and textures mingled with good conversation, and we left happy.\n",

      "The high points of Cork are really fantastic, unfortunately there were a few snags along the way that kept them from being a really spectacular destination for me, which is unfortunate since it's about a block from my doorstep. I don't know if we actually even intended on dining at Cork, but after a pretty disappointing tasting at the Cork Market just up the street our palates were already whetted by the acidity of crisp Spanish white wines, and when Elle suggests going to eat somewhere how can anyone say no?When we walked in I instantly loved the vibe and the look of the place, very reminiscent of some sort of artisanal French shop turned into bar. There are a few tables around the perimeter, but there's no denying the bar takes center stage here, even protruding out into the main dining area with an extension. We arrived just after 7 on a Friday with no reservations and were told it would only be a quick wait, so we sidled up to the bar and grabbed a glass of wine. Before we could even pay the hostess informed us they were clearing off a table already, very surprising, but pleasing, given the lack of reservations on a weekend. Don't let that fool you though, this place is always packed when I walk by, so do anticipate a wait.The brief prelude we had at the bar allowed me to quickly take in their wine list, and although I was quite impressed by the size of the by the glass options, I wasn't all that thrilled by the actual content. We both remarked that nothing really jumped out at us as intriguing (until later in the night when we noticed a Pinot Grigio that alluded to saffron and lime, which I still think has to be bullshit), but it's really nice that they pour you a sample of anything you order before you commit to it. I went with a Rose, one of my favorite summer indulgences, and was surprised by the still pervasive strawberry notes (these usually fade quickly after their Spring time release), and Elle chose a Pinot Noir which was drinkable but not all that great.When presented with the choice of dining inside or out we quickly jumped on the chance to sit on the patio. Inside the bar was somewhat noisy, and it was actually one of the most beautiful days in months, so we couldn't pass up the opportunity. The patio seating is a bit claustrophic, but once you start eating and drinking you quickly forget what's going on around you. The food provides perhaps the easiest juxtaposition of quality at Cork, with some things being done wonderfully and others falling very flat, although they all sound incredibly appealing on the menu.The first course to arrive was the grilled sardines on a bed of lettuce with a bit of red pepper, and that description is essentially where all the good part stops. These were bland, tasted nothing like sardines, and the only redeeming factor was that they had been de-boned for you. I really only recommend this dish for people who like the idea of fish but not the actual taste of them. Next out was the rosemary chicken liver pate with bruschetta and pickled shallot. This was Elle's choice, and by the end of the meal she forgot we even had it, if that tells you anything about the impression it left. For me it was slightly less pleasant than that, even, as I didn't think the rosemary helped enough to liven up the harsh minerality of the liver.The two following dishes however completely redeemed Cork, even if they were the cheapest of all the things we ordered. At $7 for a tiny bowl of mushrooms it might seem like quite a hike, but these were prepared beautifully, preserving so much natural mushroom flavor but elevating them quite a bit with the addition of madeira and marjoram. The fries are tossed with parsley, garlic, and a heavy amount of lemon zest, something totally new for me, and now rank near the top of my favorites in all of DC. The housemade ketchup with just a hint of spice definitely helps the combination pull together nicely.We wrapped up the main portion of the meal with the duck confit, a quizzical pairing of tradition and nuance, with its addition of roasted spaghetti squash, cranberry compote, and pumpkin seed oil. The duck meat itself was flaky and tender, with a great golden crust, but the accompaniment just fell flat. If anything I liked the cranberry compote, but only because it helped me forget the little strands of squash which were forgettably bland.Prior to dessert we each took another glass of wine, and the second time around the selections fared far better, with a delicious Grenache based Cotes du Rhone for me and some of the grand Royal Tokaji dessert wine for Elle (which they surreptitiously snatched up too soon, but replaced with a full glass when I complained). Neither of us were big fans of the warm apple crostada, with salted caramel, and vanilla bean Calvados ice cream, because frankly we barely tasted anything other than the hint of apple. The ginger-caramel Pot de Crème with candied pistachios however was magnificent.\n",

      "Infant friendly. Have always loved this place and now more so that we've successfully enjoyed a happy hour with our newborn. We're still trying to figure out where we can take him, but this place makes the list. We pulled up to the bar and enjoyed an amazing bottle of rose with the must-have avocado bread / crisps. Seriously try them. And bring your newborn (Friday at about 6pm).\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm surprised this place doesn't have higher reviews. �My friend and I came here on a rainy Saturday night and left feeling warm and happy. �The flights seemed strangely prices so we stuck with glasses but I was not disappointed. �I had prosecco and then a nice French red and both were generous pours and very good. �Additionally our waitress kept us well-plied with water and was very nice and patient with us as we had a million questions and couldn't decide what to order. �We ended up with the arugula salad with shallot vinaigrette, the avocado toast, a cheese plate with a goat, sheep and cow cheese and a plate of soprasetta. �This was slightly too much food but I will add that the portions are quite small here; we got barely a tablespoon of the cheeses. �That being said, at this point I was quite stuffed and appreciated the smaller portions. �They also priced complimentary bread and butter. �The avocado toast was probably the best thing we ate; the crumbled pistachios are a really unique addition to such a basic dish. �The salad was also delicious! �Cork was pretty empty when we got there but by tj time we left it had filled up. �A table near us was celebrating something (maybe an engagement) and they were brought complimentary champagne--an fyi if you're thinking of getting engaged soon!\n",
      "\n",
      "A good wine bar nearby is very much like having that get out of jail free card in your back pocket. Date night? Check. Family in town? Check. �Just need a drink a small bite? Check. We had a very nice meal at Cork and some tasty wines as well (kinda important). The plates are appropriately sized, some were outstanding and over all well-paced. Our server was very helpful and attentive. We did two different 'flights' - three glasses of a similar style. We had a white burgundy flight and a rose flight. Needless to say the white burgundies were all very, very good. The roses were mostly average, but not bad. I don't recall all of the dishes we had and for some reason forgot to take pictures of them (there were only 5 or 6 really). The avocado bruschetta was one of my favorites and would order again (must try). It's thin sliced avocado on bread with toasted pistachio, sea salt and olive oil. We also really enjoyed the braised kale with roasted garlic and pecorino. It had the right amount of garlic and salt and cheese. A true standout with an ingredient hard to make awesome. �I also enjoyed the salt roasted local beet salad with pine nuts and feta and we also tried the grilled artichoke. We probably should have stopped there because the last dish we ordered was the grilled mackerel which was only mediocre. There are other things I would try but the menu is on the small side if you're looking for a spot to return to often. We also didn't try any of the cheese or charcuterie so that's an entire section that they pair well with the wine. We skipped the dessert but some things do look intriguing like strawberry short cake or warm apple crostada with bourbon ice cream (yum). I wouldn't say the value is amazing and not a super cheap place but would you really want a wine bar to be the low cost provider? It was a nice meal with some highlights and some ok-lights. Great wine selection too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably the best wine bar that I've ever been to. �We came for an early weeknight dinner and the tables were empty though the bar was full. �We were greeted cordially and immediately seated.Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable and ready to make suggestions about anything on the menu: wine, cheese, food. �We both really appreciated his comments and feedback...even steering us away from the wrong direction when we originally ordered something that he thought was a bit lackluster in comparison to his recommendation. �I appreciate that type of honesty in a server. �I had the seasonal Australian Sparklers wine flight (2 white and 1 rose). �They were pretty dry and increasingly sweeter which paired well with the meal. �My only qualm was that because it was a wine flight and it was sparkling wine, I wish that each of the wines came out separately rather than all at once. �Because my last wine had been sitting out for the entire meal, it had lost most of its bubbles and was less sparkling as I am sure it was intended to be. �Dishes are meant to be shared and they have a mix of both cold and hot plates. �We ordered a selection of 3 cheeses. �My favorite was the Bucheron (which tasted like brie--it was delicious) which was also served with a raisin nut bread and a red wine reduction with honey glaze. �It was a perfect pairing. �We also ordered the duck salami from the charcuterie which was salty but delicious and the foie gras. �The braised kale was the highlight of the entire meal--perfectly cooked (tender but still crisp), roasted garlic, and a parmesan-like cheese on top. �It was delicious! �Finally, we ordered the duck confit (although in hindsight, I think I would have preferred to order something a little bit lighter--like maybe one of the seafood choices). �It was cooked perfectly...very juicy and served with some frisee, strong cheese (tasted like a gorgonzola) and cherries. �Overall, the dishes were tasty, well-paired, and plated beautifully. �The small little touches like candied hazelnuts or spiced nuts were great. �Everything was ever so slightly too salty, however. �So, by the end of the meal, I was munching on white bread just to clense the saltiness out of my palate.The meal and atmosphere was great. �Loved the service and the attention to detail in plating and pairing. �A great date night experience and worth a try! �I can't wait to come back!\n",

      "We arrived at Corked around 8 on a Saturday night and they informed us that to sit at a table we would have to order food. We wouldnt have minded so much had the bar area been more than A row of seats. That's probably one of my biggest gripes about \"wine bars\"....they should really focus on an atmosphere of drinking wine rather than the facade of being a restaurant. Get a bigger bar/lounge area, Cork.Other than that, they only had 4 wine flights (one was a sparkling flight and one was a rose flight, so that was out). I had kind of hoped for more flight options, so that was dissapointing. We ordered a cheese/charcuterie board and that was pretty amazing. I think this could have been a cool place, we weren't too sure though because it was extremely dark inside and we literally had to pick up the candle on the table to read the menu, so that was weird. Service seemed decent and the wine was not bad, but I personally think the best wine bar in U Street is Vinoteca, hands down.\n",

      "Cork has inspired me to give all the neighborhood restaurants another chance. When Cork opened, I went there for drinks with my girlfriends and had a great time. However, it was always crowded so I never really went back. (This is more a reflection on how impatient I am)Last night, I actually sat down for dinner and it was fabulous. The waiter (I wish I had gotten his name) was really truly amazing. We got the bass, chicken and asparagus. We also shared the flight of rose. The food was great, the flight was even better and the service was the best. We got there early so we didn't have a problem getting seated right away; however, there was long wait when we left. Cork allows you to call 30 minutes ahead to place your name on the list, which I would recommend if you are going during heavy traffic times. Also, check the price of the wine before you order. My friend had a little sticker shock when she realized our two glasses of wine at the bar were $32 dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Love this place. It is sleek, but not too sleek (the back rooms are a little more laid back). The bartender was very helpful and suggested that I try a \"threesome\" sampler (in red, white, rose, and sparkling wines). The samplers start at $11-12 - a pretty good deal. Would like to go back for food but, in the meantime, will give it four stars for going above and beyond: in service, substance, and elegant FUN.\n",

      "Delicious anchovies and red peppers on good bread, great flank steak, very good artichoke dish. The only dish that was just good was the fried calamari and shrimp - with a slightly odd tasting caper mayonnaise. My husband had two very good reds, I had a flight of Proseccos. We liked the combination of the ambiance and the high quality of food and wine. My husband and I would be happy to return, and we both have very discriminating palates due to alot of dining in Europe and cities in the US with high level dining. DC needs more places like this one! Also very nice, helpful and discreet waiter. No \"Hi, my name is Bob and I will be your server\"!\n",
      "\n",
      "It's not hard to love the combination of a wide variety of wine by the glass, lots of excellent small plates, and a happy buzz from like-minded (and thus right-thinking) fellow patrons.Their flights are a fun way to explore their cellar, even if last night they disappointed with the rose and the rhone; the cava flight was well received, but bubbles find it easy to please...The biggest problem Cork has is crowding, and thus their table policies; we aren't so punctual a town that refusing to seat \"until the entire party is present\" makes sense. �I'd rather they increased their price a touch and relaxed that policy, so that Cork wasn't a chore, as much as it is a pleasure.Another is that (apparently from now on) you have to reserve a spot in their tastings with a credit card (so far so good), by filling out a word document with all your credit card info, and then mailing it back to an AOL address. �That's incredibly sketchy, and I refused. �A web interface to prepay for tastings is fine, an open table reservation that requires a credit card is fine, but I wasn't sure if this wasn't a member of the staff engaging in a little opportunistic identity theft!Nevertheless, I'll be back - I just won't bring as many friends, and I won't attend tastings until they clarify and reassure about the prepayment policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food is as good as ever, but the front of the house needs some work; their table management is not very efficient. �Having said that, the menu had changed slightly since my last visit. �The chicken liver pate with rosemary was still there, as was the avocado sashimi, but the recently added sauteed leaks with burratta was to die for! �They seemed to have changed up the wines by the glass as well; look for Southern French blends; there are some real gems there. �And don't forget those cocktails, a legacy of former expert bartender Tom Brown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cork is great, *if* you can get in. They get really crowded during peak hours, so maybe call ahead and get your name on the list.The pros: Great wine selection (obviously), good food, good service. I recommend the rosemary chicken liver bruschetta, the kale, and the lemon and black pepper calamari. The leeks were decent, and I'd pass on the house-cured trout. I assume that the wine flights are a regular feature. They're a great way to try a couple variations on a theme.The cons: Very noisy, small tables, a little $$ for what you actually get. For a dinner, I'd budget $45-60pp.Overall, definitely worth a try.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me preface this review with, \"I LOVE WINE!!!\" �So I'm always excited by the prospects of a new wine bar in my general vicinity.This place is a solid 3.5 stars. I'd give it 4 stars for wine, service, and ambiance and 3 stars for food and price point. I will definitely be coming back, but I'm coming back with a game plan based on the following observations:The Good: Selection and user-friendly descriptions of the various wines available by the glass and bottle are great. The available 3-wine flights (that change monthly) are also a great way to explore wine themes such as sparkling whites, riojas, etc. I haven't had a bad wine yet, and have had some pleasant surprises. The service was also excellent, even though the place was pretty busy. The Okay: The food is okay, nothing spectacular. The rosemary chicken liver bruschetta was pretty tasty, but both this and the avocado pistachio dishes could have used some salt and less bread. The french fries and homemade ketchup were tasty, but the steak was pretty tough and again lacked salt. Overall the prices are what you would expect for the area and a wine bar (about 20% higher than they should be) but the pours are pretty solid and the portions decent enough.The Plan: Wine bars (or at least the patrons in them) should stick to simple foods and leave the emphasis on the wine, which I will do here in the future. Do I really want anything more than cheese, charcuterie, and bread, or homemade fries, ketchup, and house-cured olives with my wine? �Not really. This is a place to hang out, enjoy wine, and snack on the basics, not a place to have dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Came by for drinks on friday night with a party of four. Was close to closing, so we managed only one round, after waiting 15 or so minutes for a place to sit to open up. The wine list did look impressive, but we got a bad round of wine. My burgundy ($12/glass) was flat and devoid of any body or character. �The moscato and rose were similar flat. �Seemed like the wines had been open too long or not properly managed for consumption over the course of the evening.I would come back, because their list seems very deep, but not on a friday or saturday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dining at Cork is a bizarre experience, to say the least. �Drinking there is nothing short of irritating. �And the pours were NOT generous.First off, as a pure \"wine bar\", you might as well forget about it. �Proof and Veritas are infinitely better; the bar area at Cork is right in the middle of a small and busy dining room, and it's very difficult to just go in and have a drink. �For table seating you must order food, so, as a wine bar, Cork really misses. �My GF and I went on a weekday night, plenty of seating and were denied service, since we didn't plan to eat.As a wine-themed restaurant, Cork misses by miles. �It is highly strange to have a small plates menu with suggested wine pairings and then not serve tasting portions and bring the food out in \"whatever\" order. �My date and I ordered bruschetta, potatoes, chicken and lamb. �She ordered the wine paired with the chicken (a rose, if you can believe it [it was good though]), and I got the red paired with the lamb. �Guess which dish came first? �the lamb!Well, this seems odd. � You are supposed to drink wine in increasing order of heaviness, so we blew our palates out with the uber red that paired with the lamb.Now, this might be OK if the food was great; it's not. �It's decidedly average. �The lamb was not made to order, but clearly braised and covered in heavy sauce (claimed to be pomegranate). �The chicken was very well prepared, but pretty bland. �The potatoes were good, though a bit undercooked (amazing since they were the last to be served and took forever to come out). �The bruschetta was decent.Now, to the most egregious aspect of our evening: the pours. �My date and I had two glasses of wine each. �We were informed of the wine \"flights\" (no menu for the flights...weird), but chose to get single servings. �They came out and I thought we had been given a tasting portion. �It was �by no means a 4 oz. pour. �For the price (between 8-12 bucks a glass on average), this is incredibly steep, especially when both Veritas and Proof provide a full 4oz pour for similar prices. �We noticed a couple next to us getting wine flights, and their pours were almost the same as ours!!?!?!So, in short, Cork is amazingly overpriced, very crowded, and has mediocre food. �Expect it to be voted Best Wine Bar in DC!\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree with the other yelpers...my rating would be a 4 or 5 if it weren't for the crappy service. We arrived around 8:15 on Friday night. We expected a wait - that's fine - and were told that we could go to the bar and wait. Umm...where at the bar? I didn't expect a seat, but there was nowhere to stand without being in the way. We were told it would be about 45 minutes so we went over to Masa 14 for a couple of drinks and returned about 35 minutes later. And then we waited...and waited some more. They kept telling us that it would only be a few minutes. An hour and half later, we were seated. At that point, we were already pretty turned off. Like I said, I'm fine with a wait, and also understanding if it's 10-15 minutes above the anticipated wait time. But 45 minutes above...not ok. To their credit, the food was really good. We shared 4 plates (steak - cooked perfectly, olives, calamari - incredible sauce!, fries - oh my, so good). We also both had their sparkling wine flight. This place would have been a definite return, but at this point, I don't think I want to put myself through that again. Also, would it have killed them to hand us a glass of wine or prosecco while we waited to acknowledge their screw up? That would have at least bumped them up to 4 stars...oh well.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wanted to like this place a lot. I really did. The concept is cute (if a bit trite by now), and the place itself is really actually pretty nice. There were just a few trip-ups, \"quirks\" and other abnormalities that left a bad taste in my mouth at Cork (and it wasn't from the wine!). The restaurant and bar itself are divided into three areas - There's the front dining room with the bar and host station, a middle area that's on a mezzanine and a rear dining room that is quieter but deals with the bustle of the kitchen. There's a tasteful exposed brick, tin ceiling, concrete floor theme going that is well-executed and the lighting is soft enough to make the whole thing seem intimate. I went with a friend recently and we really enjoyed the food and wine - We each had a glass of red, a glass of white and a glass of a dessert rose and we shared the avocado toast, duck confit and scallops. The prices are a bit high for what you get, but everything is at least presented nicely - Our only quandary was with the fact that for $11, you get two scallops. Well, at least we got to taste them. Either way, the food is actually well-prepared and thoughtfully executed. The wine list is extensive which helps, although the prices (in my opinion) are beyond ridiculous for this area of Washington, D.C. My favorite Côtes du Rhône costs $12 per bottle, so why should it be $12 per glass in this, Washington D.C.'s most beloved \"up-and-coming\" neighborhood? This isn't Georgetown, dear. As I mentioned, there were a few things that really did not rub me the right way here. Their reservation rules are bizarre and absolutely unnecessary as far as I'm concerned - Something like you can call 45 minutes in advance to get your name on a list, but not make a reservation. My friend and I ended up waiting about 30 minutes for table to open up (ample time to buy some egregiously overpriced Côtes du Rhône from the bar) and were finally seated at what may have been the worst table in the house - The one right by the kitchen door and next to a window looking into the kitchen which bathed our table in lovely fluorescent light. The waitress, while feigning pleasantness, was transparently uninterested in anything but setting forth the absolute pretense which has probably seeped into her brain by now and kindly reminded us that they have \"Old World\" wines only... Meaning, only European wines so forget your favorite Sonoma vintner, for he is not good enough for Columbia Heights. The crowd was robust and mostly middle aged, but everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. For what it is, I'd say I will look forward to going back to Cork to have some wine and a small amuse-bouche, although I don't know if it'll really be a destination again.\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend and I love to try out new DC restaurants and wine bars. �We usually end up having wonderful experiences. �We recently tried Cork, and had mixed feelings. �When we first arrived, the hostess tried to seat us in the back of the restaurant, near the kitchen. �There wasn't enough room to sit on one side of the table, due to it being jammed against the back of another table. �We thought to pull out the table, but then realized we would be in the direct route of the servers to and from the kitchen. �In addition, we were seated next to an adorable child who was very unhappy and belted out screams to let us know. �We asked for a different table and was told that we could sit at the bar (there were tables for 4 available, but we were told we couldn't sit at them). �Taking this suggestion, we found 2 seats and had an excellent bartender. �He allowed us to try 2 wines before recommending a fabulous bottle of white. �Although they had an extensive selection of wines by the glass, the 2 we tried must have been their worst. �I really enjoy a nice dry French rose (which can be difficult to find at most restaurants), and the one they had listed as a French rose was more like a white zinfandel that I can pick up at any store for $5/bottle. �The bartender misunderstood me when I said that I liked a \"dry\" rose.We ordered a cheese plate, and asked the server to pick out 3 cheeses for us. �This was fabulous - we loved the selection (although a bit small for $10). �We had also ordered calamari, steak and fries. �The cheese came out first, then the steak and fries. �The steak was wonderful - cooked to perfection and a nice size for the price. �The fries were extremely overdone and took a few tastes to get used to the sauce that accompanied them. �When we finally finished everything, the server asked if we had ever received the calamari. �Since we had already finished our meal/wine, and had ordered the calamari at least an hour or more prior to this, we assumed the kitchen forgot, so we took our servers offer to just remove it from our bill. �5 min later, our server came out with the calamari and asked if we wanted it explaining that it just came up. �We again said \"no thanks\" and he agreed. �No more than 2 minutes after this, another gentleman (he introduced himself as the owner) came out with the same plate of calamari. �He explained to us that since Cork is a \"tapa's/small plate\" restaurant, the food can come out at any time and in any order. � Now I have been to tapa's places all around the DC area and have never had an item that was ordered over an hour ago arrive and been expected to eat and pay for it. �I realize some plates take longer to cook/prepare than others, but I've never had to wait that long for fried calamari. �The owner was very pushy and rude about the entire situation. �He agreed to take it off the bill, but was reluctant. �Face it, they simply forgot, just let it go - right?? �Apparently not.I was extremely disappointed in the actions of the owner. �I thought that he was unprofessional and rude. �Because of this, I would NOT recommend this restaurant to ANYONE and will NEVER go back. �I can find much better wines/food/service/prices at other restaurants in the DC metro area and enjoy a more pleasant experience. �Go to \"Proof\" instead!\n",
      "\n",
      "We compromised on a rose and paired it with the steak, fried shrimp/calamari, avocado bread, mushrooms etc. etc. and it was all great! This was unlike some of the other \"small plate\" places I've been to because we left and were actually full. Plus we got the clutch outdoor table and could people watch the entire meal. Can't wait to go back to DC and try the rest of the menu\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a true wine bar. The staff and ownership has extensive knowledge of wine, but even more importantly, they make it accessible. There are nightly flights of red, white, rose, and bubbly, and the descriptions of all the wines on the menu would take a good evening sitting with a glass to sip just to read through!The food is top-notch. I hope they added the special avocado bruschetta to the menu: thin slices of ripe avocado with chopped pistachios atop grilled bread might be the most perfect tapa-style dish ever created. I have tried most of the smaller dishes on the menu; the calamari and rock shrimp (fried, of course...fried things seem to be a theme in my Yelp reviews) were the best I've had just about anywhere, and that includes the ten years I spend living in New England! I also had the fish \"entree\" special the first time I went -- the entrees are smaller than your typical main course, to allow for sharing several among the diners. White-fleshed fish is sometimes bland, but this was so perfectly cooked, seasoned, and absolutely delicious I refused to give a bit to my companions. The cheese offerings are also high quality, a must at a wine bar; they don't shy away from offering powerful triple-cremes and pungent blues. Bread, cheese, and wine might be the only three food groups I need...in which case, Cork, can I move in?\n",
      "\n",
      "Brought my out-of-town sister to Cork last night, and I'm sorry to say I wouldn't spend my money there again. Service was okay -- the hostesses are always too cool for school, but I can forgive that. Our waitress was a doll but mixed up our order, which I think is why one of our hot tapas plates was lukewarm by the time we got it (the flank steak with way-too-bitter brocolli raab). The french fries were crispy but needed salt (which they don't put on the table, like most places who think their food is above that), and the homemade catsup was unedible, as was the rosemary chicken liver bruschetta with homemade chutney. The only thing we devoured was the bread and butter you get when you're seated, and the fontina cheese brioche, which is basically fancy grilled cheese, and thankfully they didn't mess that up. Cork should stick to what it knows best and just serve wine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great service, good wine, and fun atmosphere. �I'm so glad to have this wine bar close to my home because wine bars in DC are such a gem. �Unlike NY, where wine bars are a dime a dozen, there's only a few in DC where one can really go to enjoy themselves at a wine bar. �On a warm Friday evening, there's nothing better than to sit outside with friends, enjoying a bottle of rose chatting about weekend plans. �I would definitely suggest coming before 6pm if you don't want to wait a long time. �Better yet, make a reservation and save yourself the hassle of waiting.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have now been to Cork twice in a one month time frame and am definitely a fan! The wine list is great (although I'm used to paying NY prices which is how their wines are definitely priced). To be fair, I think it has something to do with the fact that they have Tokaji on the menu which I love. We have only been on the very early side (5:30ish where we were able to get a seat at the bar because they had just started seating everyone who was waiting for the first tables of the night) and the very late side - after 10:30. Both times we ordered the cheese plate (big fan of their selection) and the oil-cured roma tomatos with chevre on grilled bread (obsessed with this dish and ps, you know it's a good choice when the owners are eating it also nearby!) I selected the rosemary chicken liver bruschetta. At first I thought the chicken liver had an odd after taste, but when paired with the shallott marmalade, I could no longer detect it and felt the dish was complete. We finished with the flat iron steak (loved the horseradish sauce). We will be back - there are too many amazing things left to try on the menu. Hopefully we will be able to stick to the early or late side - nervous to see what this place looks like at 8pm.\n",
