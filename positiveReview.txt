I get it for kids and so far they love itIt made a great Christmas Gift. Thanks!
Great computer. Haven't had any issues with it. It does everything I want it to do. it's fast. The only issue I have is getting use to Windows 10 from Windows Vista.
Solid computer for standard usage at a good price. Not a gaming pc, but if you aren't picky, it can probably work for that in a pinch too.Haven't got it yet but know it will be great
I just needed a simple lap top to watch movies while connected to the tv and for my sewing classes. It works fine no complaints so far.Very fast, and stable laptop
windows 10 takes a little practice, but screen is clear and the dell is very fast with the wireless connection. uploads are fast ,also- SSD. It's faster than your regular notebook with HDD.
- Latest generation of Intel's entry-level processor.
- Windows 10 is a perfect fit.
- Really big screen.
- Really light.
- Hibernate and wake up in a matter of seconds.
If you are someone who doesn't require a lot of storage space, this is a great entry level laptop for you. The performance boost from an SSD (even a low end SSD) will far outweigh many other upgrades including additional RAM. This system is a perfect combination of processor + RAM + SSD for the price. When you purchase, be sure to check for updates in Settings -> Update and Security for the latest Windows 1511 build that was released. The update will take some time to install but when installed it will improve speed by about 30% for startup and regular usage.
This laptop is just what I was looking for. Its much lighter than my old Inspiron, but it has the same feel (plus a numpad). Everything runs smoothly on that SSD and since I have other computers that I use as media storage, I don't mind the relatively low disk space of 128 gb. This laptop is a really awesome deal for the price. It just runs so smooth and quickly (solid state drive + intel pentium processor), the screen is nice and big (im a big person), the keyboard feels great (just like the older Dell Inspirons), and it is not at all heavy (although obviously not as lightweight as chromebooks, etc). The computer doesn't have a dvd disk drive, but I dont need it and not having it makes it that much lighter to hold and carry around. Given the price, what i needed, and what other laptops are out there, The wife complains it's slow compared to her work laptop, but I don't see that as a problem. Can't beat the price for a computer that will be used for MS Office and internet browsing only; Videos from YouTube or MS Edge worked fine with some hiccups when there's 2 open streaming videos; Battery lasted a few hours with normal use; lightweight, thin body. One problem I see years from now would be broken screen hinges. It closes tight on the hinges and this was a problem with my old Dell laptop. After 6 years, it broke off at one of the hinges and a few months later - no more screen display. But then, that one lasted 6 years so I'm hoping this new one will too.
